# Custom Product Carousel

This is a custom product carousel built for the e-bebek homepage.  
It shows product cards using data from a provided JSON file.

I have faced some issues:
- The responsiveness of the carousel didnâ€™t work as expected, so I had to remove it. I think this happened because I started implementing the page structure incorrectly.
- There are some CSS issues with the favorite icons, but the mechanism itself works. These issues might occur because I tried to reference assets from the original website.

## Notes
The carousel only uses the given product data.  
Because of this, some parts are not included:
- Product rating stars
- Number of reviews
- Bestseller labels
